# OpenCV-Based-Face-and-Eye-Detection
This project demonstrates how to detect faces and eyes in static images using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier. It highlights the basic application of computer vision for feature detection, useful in real-world scenarios like facial recognition, surveillance, and image processing systems.

 ### Overview: 
Using OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar cascades, the system scans an image to identify human faces and eyes. Detected regions are highlighted with bounding boxes, helping visualize how the algorithm works on real images.

### Features:
•	Detects human faces in images
•	Detects eyes within detected faces
•	Uses Haar Cascade Classifiers (pre-trained XML models)
•	Simple and lightweight Python implementation
•	Can process any input image

### Technologies Used:
•	Python
•	OpenCV (cv2)
•	Haar Cascade Classifiers
